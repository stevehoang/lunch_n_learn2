<q>Much of the work of a computational biologist involves reframing biological questions in a rigorous mathematical context. Once this is accomplished we can use the tools of applied mathematics to gain insight into the biology.</q>

<q>Major problems in each field can be addressed with a technique known as __linear__ __programming__.</q>

---

## A little history

> - Linear programming is a subfield of mathematical programming (B.K.A. mathematical optimization)
> - The theory behind linear programming was worked out in the 1940s by Soviet and American mathematicians (primarily Leonid Kantorovich, George Dantzig, and John von Neumann).
> - The development was motivated by the desire to solve complex logistical military problems.
> - The words "program" / "programming" do not refer to computer programming. Rather, they refer to logistics schedules, which were referred to as "programs" by the U.S. military at the time.
> - Linear programming is now ubiquitous. Many industires with high logistical demands are wholly reliant linear programming and related techniques; e.g., airlines, delivery services, etc.

## What does a linear program look like?

### You loved them; they're back: Word problems.

Meremy Jauldin just founded "Humvees n' Hickories Barbecue Company" where he expects to find his fortune and true calling. He plans on starting off with an offering of pulled pork, and of course his greatest passion, brisket. The profit margins on batches of pork and brisket are \\$300 and \$500, respectively. Meremy's secret 2-step smoking process requires both hickory and apple wood. The brisket takes 15 hours in the hickory smoker and 3 hours in the apple wood smoker. The pork takes 3 hours in the hickory smoker and 12 hours in the apple wood smoker. He's got 120 smoker-hours per smoker per week. He wants to make at least 3 batches of each offering per week. How many batches of each should he make (and sell) per week to maximize his profits?

## How can we mathematically define an LP?
The first step is to define all of the constraints.

The constraints on the hickory smoker:
$$15b+3p\leq120$$

Next we need to define the "objective function," which is profit in this case:
$$P=300p+500b$$

Now we have the full linear program:

constraints:
$$15b+3p\leq120$$
$$3b+12p\leq120$$
$$p\geq3$$
$$b\geq3$$
objective:
$$P=300p+500b$$

## A remarkable theorem

1. (3, 3)
2. (6.32, 8.42)
3. (3, 9.25)
4. (7.4, 3)

1. (3, 3)
2. (6.32, 8.42)
3. (3, 9.25)
4. (7.4, 3)

The objective function (i.e., profits) are maximized when b=6.32 and p=8.42:
$$P(b,p)=500b+300p$$
$$P(6.32,8.42)=500\times6.32+300\times8.42=5686$$

Spend your new fortune wisely, Meremy!

## Moving into higher dimensions

The barbecue problem was a 2 dimensional problem with 4 inequalities (constraints). A three dimensional problem has (surprise!) a 3 dimensional solution space. The number of inequalities determines the number of facets of the polytope.

## How is LP used in computational biology?

### Problems in computational biology are very diverse. The applications of such a general technique is largely limited by the creativity of the user.

> - Cancer diagnosis
> - Biological sequence alignment
> - Protein folding models
> - Haplotype retrevial with missing information
> - Prediction of disease susceptibility given genotypes
> - Genome-scale prediction of metabolite utilzation (i.e., flux)

## _In silico_ target search

<div style='text-align: center;'>
    <img height='400' src='./assets/img/prod_of_ppcoa_resting_1.png' />
</div>

To conduct a target search we add constraints to the model to simulate a therapeutic intervention. E.g., we can constrain the flux through a particular reaction to be zero, which simulates the effect of an inhibitor. Constraints that reduce the predicted production of P-CoA correspond to potential targets.
